  <div class="about-content">
    <p> Privet again! My name is Kislorod and I'm aspiring web developer! </p>
    <p> This blog is my first try and I'm very happy that you can see it! I hope that in future I'll create a lot of beautiful websites, apps and other useful things. I'm very inspired with coding, it feels so easy and fun to me, maybe it's really something mine? Coding is my very long-term dream that can make me more independant and free in my life! So wish me good luck and stay in touch! BTW you can find links on my Facebook and Instagram where you can always find and contact me! Kisses xoxoxo </p>

        <p> I don't know exactly, but I hope that she wished us all the best! I just wanna try some features in coding, so I used this picture. I hope she is enjoing her life as well (if she still alive, cause the pic looks pretty old). </p>

  <p><strong>Privet everyone!</strong> My name is Kristina, I was born in <br>

    but all I want to say: I just LOVE coding and dream about being a proper <br>
    <em>web developer</em>!</p>
